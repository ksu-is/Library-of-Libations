Library of Libations will be a website that allows users to look up how to make their favorite cocktails. Not only will this be a database of drink recipes that everyone should know but as a library of your personal drink creations as well.

I will be using Flask as my web framework creating a website that has different pages for different types of cocktails and etc...

To achieve this I will be editing the code here: https://github.com/itsimplified/slick-crud-app
